# Lung X-Ray Image Classifier (ResNet50)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (lung-x-ray-classifier-resnet.ipynb) that demonstrates the fine-tuning of ResNet50 to classify lung X-ray images. The model is trained to distinguish between normal lung X-rays and images belonging to 9 different disease categories. Please note: This is a prototype and should not be used for medical diagnosis.
