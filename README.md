# Lung X-Ray Image Classifier

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the fine-tuning of ResNet50 and ViT to classify lung X-ray images. The models are trained to distinguish between normal lung X-rays and images belonging to 9 different disease categories. Please note: This is a demo and should not be used for medical diagnosis.

The dataset used in this project was curated and uploaded by Ferdinando Feltrin and is available on Kaggle here:
